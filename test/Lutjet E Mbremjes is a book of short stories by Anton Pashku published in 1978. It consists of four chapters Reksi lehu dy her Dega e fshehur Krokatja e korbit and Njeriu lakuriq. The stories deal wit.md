## "NjÃ« ditÃ« nÃ« jetÃ«n time" (A Day in My Life)
 
This story is one of the most autobiographical ones in the collection. It depicts a day in the life of a writer who is constantly monitored and censored by the communist authorities. The writer wakes up early in the morning and goes to his office, where he has to write propaganda articles for the newspaper. He is not allowed to express his own opinions or creativity, and he has to follow strict rules and guidelines. He is also harassed and threatened by his colleagues and superiors, who are loyal to the regime and try to manipulate him.
 
The writer feels suffocated and frustrated by his situation. He longs for freedom and authenticity, but he is afraid of the consequences if he rebels. He tries to find some solace in his family and friends, but they are also affected by the oppression and fear. He also tries to escape through his dreams and memories, but they are often interrupted by reality. He feels isolated and hopeless, and he wonders if there is any meaning or purpose in his life.
 
This story is a powerful critique of the communist regime in Albania, which suppressed any form of dissent or individuality. It also shows the psychological effects of living under such conditions, which can lead to depression, anxiety and despair. The story is written in a realistic and simple style, but it also uses some elements of surrealism and absurdism, such as the recurring motif of a black cat that symbolizes bad luck and death. The story also has a circular structure, as it ends with the same sentence as it begins: "Nuk kam gjumÃ«" (I can't sleep).
