You need to purchase one year of maintenance along with each new software license. After the first year, you can choose to renew your maintenance or not. If you renew your maintenance, you will receive a renewal notice and pay a fee. If you do not renew your maintenance, you will lose access to free software upgrades and technical support. Most customers prefer to keep their maintenance active so that they can benefit from the latest software features and get help from our experts whenever they need it.
  
Software upgrades are important for keeping your software up to date and secure. They may include bug fixes, performance improvements, compatibility enhancements, and new features. With active maintenance, you can download and install any software upgrade that we release during your maintenance term for free. You can also request a CD-ROM with the latest software version for a nominal fee.

Technical support is available for helping you with any issues or questions that you may have regarding your software. You can contact our technical support team by phone, email, or online chat during our business hours. Our team consists of experienced and qualified professionals who can assist you with installation, configuration, troubleshooting, and usage of your software. With active maintenance, you can access unlimited technical support during your maintenance term.
  
Maintenance renewal is optional but highly recommended. If you do not renew your maintenance before it expires, you will not be able to receive free software upgrades and technical support. You will also have to pay a higher fee if you decide to reactivate your maintenance later. To avoid any interruption in your service and to save money, we suggest that you renew your maintenance before the end of your current term. You will receive a renewal notice by email or mail before your maintenance expires. You can renew your maintenance online, by phone, or by mail.
