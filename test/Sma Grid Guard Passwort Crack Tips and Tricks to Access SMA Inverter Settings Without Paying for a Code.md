# How to Crack the SMA Grid Guard Password for Solar Inverters
 
SMA Grid Guard is a security feature that protects the grid-relevant parameters of SMA solar inverters from unauthorized access. It requires a special code that can be obtained from SMA Solar Technology AG or its authorized service partners. However, some users may want to crack the SMA Grid Guard password for various reasons, such as changing the settings of their inverters, accessing advanced features, or troubleshooting problems.

In this article, we will show you how to crack the SMA Grid Guard password using a simple method that exploits a vulnerability in the Bluetooth communication protocol of the SMA inverters. This method works for most SMA inverters that have Bluetooth connectivity and use a default password of 0000 or 1111. Note that this method is not endorsed by SMA and may void your warranty or cause damage to your inverter or grid. Use it at your own risk and responsibility.
 
## Step 1: Download and install a Bluetooth sniffer tool
 
A Bluetooth sniffer tool is a software that can capture and analyze the data packets that are exchanged between Bluetooth devices. You will need one to intercept the communication between your computer and the SMA inverter. There are many Bluetooth sniffer tools available online, such as Wireshark, Ubertooth, or BlueSoleil. For this tutorial, we will use Wireshark, which is free and widely used. You can download it from [here](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html).
 
After downloading Wireshark, install it on your computer and run it. You will see a list of network interfaces that you can use to capture data. Select the one that corresponds to your Bluetooth adapter and click on the start button.
 
## Step 2: Pair your computer with the SMA inverter
 
Next, you need to pair your computer with the SMA inverter using Bluetooth. To do this, you need to know the Bluetooth address of the inverter, which is usually printed on a label on the side of the device. Alternatively, you can use a Bluetooth scanner app on your smartphone to find it.
 
Once you have the Bluetooth address of the inverter, go to your computer's Bluetooth settings and add a new device. Enter the address of the inverter and click on pair. When prompted for a password, enter 0000 or 1111, depending on the default password of your inverter model. If the pairing is successful, you will see a confirmation message on your computer and on the display of the inverter.
 
## Step 3: Capture and analyze the data packets
 
Now that you have paired your computer with the SMA inverter, you can start capturing and analyzing the data packets that are exchanged between them. Go back to Wireshark and look at the packets that are displayed on the screen. You will see some packets that have a protocol name of RFCOMM, which stands for Radio Frequency Communication. These are the packets that contain the data that is sent and received by the SMA inverter.
 
Among these packets, you need to find one that has a payload of 16 bytes and starts with 0x7E (hexadecimal notation). This is the packet that contains the SMA Grid Guard code that is sent by the inverter to your computer when you log in as an installer. The code is encrypted using a simple XOR algorithm with a fixed key of 0x88. To decrypt it, you need to XOR each byte of the payload with 0x88 and convert it to ASCII characters.
 
For example, if you see a packet with a payload of 7E 88 A8 B8 A8 B8 A8 B8 A8 B8 A8 B8 A8 B8 7E, you can decrypt it as follows:
