The Time That Remains is divided into four chapters, each corresponding to a different period of Palestinian history and Suleiman's personal life. The first chapter, titled "1948", depicts the events of the Nakba, or the catastrophe, when Israel declared its independence and thousands of Palestinians were expelled or fled from their homes. The second chapter, titled "1970", shows the impact of the Six-Day War and the death of Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser on Suleiman's family and community. The third chapter, titled "1980", focuses on Suleiman's adolescence and his rebellious attitude towards school and authority. The fourth chapter, titled "Today", follows Suleiman's return to Nazareth as an adult and his observations of the changes and challenges faced by his people.
  
The film is not a conventional narrative, but rather a series of vignettes that combine realism, surrealism, comedy and tragedy. Suleiman uses a minimalist style of dialogue, sound and editing, relying mostly on visual storytelling and long takes. He also employs a deadpan expression and a passive stance as his trademark persona, contrasting with the absurdity and violence of his surroundings. He has been compared to silent film comedians like Buster Keaton and Jacques Tati, as well as contemporary directors like Roy Andersson and Aki KaurismÃ¤ki.
  
The Time That Remains is a film that explores the themes of identity, memory, resistance and survival in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It is also a personal and poetic tribute to Suleiman's father, who died in 2008, and to his mother, who suffers from Alzheimer's disease. The film is based on Suleiman's own family diaries, letters and photos, as well as his own recollections and experiences. It is a film that reflects on the past, but also questions the present and the future of Palestine.
